# Hello, my name is:
### Karl Wilson
##### I am a student and a full-time worker. In my free time I like to *learn*, produce music, and (go figure) play video games. 
##### Arguably, I do alot less of that last one, and when I do, I tend to focus on strategic and creative games or simulators like Satisfactory and Minecraft.
## I love challenging tasks. Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
